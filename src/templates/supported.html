    <h1>CubingUSA Supported Competitions</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        CubingUSA offers local organizers the <b>option</b> of running their competition under the auspices of CubingUSA.  Because CubingUSA is a registered 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, this option may be financially preferable to organizing competitions as an individual. Supported Competitions must follow CubingUSA guidelines to ensure financial accountability.
      </p>
      <h3>Requirements</h3>
      <p>
        Organizers must submit an application including a budget and other competition details at least <b>60 days in advance</b>.  Income and expenses need to be pre-approved.  All income goes to CubingUSA, and expenses may be re-imbursed with receipts.  There are limitations on what may be expensed.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <b>Deputy</b> appointed by the CubingUSA Board of Directors must participate in the organization of the competition, and must be present at the competition.  The Deputy is responsible for ensuring all relevant policies are followed, and for reporting any potential issues to the Board of Directors.
      </p>
